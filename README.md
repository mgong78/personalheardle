This project (heardle...made for you) was inspired by Heardle, a music guessing game based on the NYT's popular Wordle game. The general premise is to guess songs based on your most-listened-to tracks or artists on Spotify based on which mode the player chooses. Players will listen to around 30 seconds of a random song from their top tracks/artists, and then will have 3 guesses as to what the song is. 

I created this using a virtual environment. The packages of this virtual environment can be installed via "requirements.txt". Then, third-party modules (spotipy, flask) will need to be installed before running. Files of this project include "finalproj_mg.py," which is the main Python script with all of the game's functionality, "requirements.txt," which allows the user to install the virtual environment packages, and "templates," which is the folder containing the html templates for the game's sites.
